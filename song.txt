Road trippin' with my two favorite allies 
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies 
It's time to leave this town it's time to steal away 
Let's go get lost anywhere in the U.S.A.

Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty West of the one 
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun
